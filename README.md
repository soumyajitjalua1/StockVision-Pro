## Technical Indicators
  ### Simple Moving Average (SMA):

  
  The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over a specific number of days in the past. For example, a 20-day SMA is the average closing price over     the last 20 days. SMA is used to identify the trend direction and smooth out price data to help look at the big picture.

  ### Exponential Moving Average (EMA):


  The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is similar to the SMA, but it gives more weight to the most recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. This means the EMA will react more quickly to price changes than the SMA. EMA is commonly used to identify trends more quickly.
